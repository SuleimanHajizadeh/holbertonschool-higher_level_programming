## 🧠 What Are ABCs?

Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) define a blueprint for other classes. They enforce that subclasses implement specific methods or properties, making your code more robust and easier to maintain.

Example:

```python
from python_abc import RepositoryABC

class UserRepository(RepositoryABC):
    def get(self, id):
        # Implementation here
        return {"id": id, "name": "Alice"}

    def save(self, entity):
        # Implementation here
        print("User saved:", entity)
