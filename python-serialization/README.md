🧠 Overview

This project introduces two fundamental data-handling techniques in computer science:
Marshaling and Serialization.

Both processes deal with converting data or objects into a format that can be saved, transmitted, and reconstructed later — a key concept in networking, databases, and data persistence.

🧩 Key Concepts
Concept	Description
Marshaling	Converts objects in memory into a format suitable for storage or transmission (used in remote procedure calls).
Serialization	Converts Python data structures (e.g., dicts, lists, objects) into a transferable or storable format, and back again later.
Deserialization	Reconstructs the original Python object from a serialized format.
🧰 Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to:

✅ Differentiate between marshaling and serialization
✅ Serialize and deserialize Python objects using JSON, Pickle, CSV, and XML
✅ Understand how data formats affect performance and compatibility
✅ Apply serialization in web apps, databases, and distributed systems
